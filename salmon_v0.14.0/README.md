### salmon v0.14.0

Decoy transcriptome files were obtained from the [Salmon README](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/b1edd526e1e8cdad6f01daaba2f9dc3f2abf19f4#pre-computed-decoy-transcriptomes).

Salmon indices can be built by running `build_txome_indices.sh`.

Note that `ensembl_download.sh` and `create_hybrid_fasta.sh` were not used to generate indices (see: https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/issues/5).
They are retained here because they can potentially be used as a template in the future.
